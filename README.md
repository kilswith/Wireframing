# Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual outline of a website or app to show layout and functionality. It helps designers and stakeholders plan structure, test usability, and refine ideas early—saving time and preventing costly changes later in the design process.

# KEY Elements of Wireframing
- Layout Structure
This defines the overall arrangement of elements on a page—such as headers, footers, sidebars, and content sections.
Example: A clear three-column layout on a news site helps users easily distinguish between headlines, featured articles, and advertisements, improving readability and flow.

- Navigation
Navigation elements include menus, tabs, and buttons that guide users through different sections of the interface.
Example: A top navigation bar with labeled links (“Home,” “About,” “Contact”) ensures users can quickly find information and move around the site without confusion.

- Content Placement
This involves deciding where text, images, and interactive elements will appear on the page.
Example: Placing key information, like a call-to-action button (“Sign Up”), near the top center helps draw users’ attention and encourages engagement.

- Functionality
Functionality in wireframes shows how interactive components—like forms, sliders, or drop-down menus—will work.
Example: Including a search bar with a filter option in the wireframe demonstrates how users can refine results, improving overall user experience.
