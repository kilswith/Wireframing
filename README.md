# Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual outline of a website or app to show layout and functionality. It helps designers and stakeholders plan structure, test usability, and refine ideas early—saving time and preventing costly changes later in the design process.

# KEY Elements of Wireframing
- Layout Structure
This defines the overall arrangement of elements on a page—such as headers, footers, sidebars, and content sections.
Example: A clear three-column layout on a news site helps users easily distinguish between headlines, featured articles, and advertisements, improving readability and flow.

- Navigation 
Navigation elements include menus, tabs, and buttons that guide users through different sections of the interface.
Example: A top navigation bar with labeled links (“Home,” “About,” “Contact”) ensures users can quickly find information and move around the site without confusion.

- Content Placement 
This involves deciding where text, images, and interactive elements will appear on the page.
Example: Placing key information, like a call-to-action button (“Sign Up”), near the top center helps draw users’ attention and encourages engagement.

- Functionality
Functionality in wireframes shows how interactive components—like forms, sliders, or drop-down menus—will work.
Example: Including a search bar with a filter option in the wireframe demonstrates how users can refine results, improving overall user experience.

# Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Wireframes

- Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, rough sketches that focus on layout and structure rather than visual details. They’re usually created early in the design process to quickly explore ideas and get feedback on basic page flow and content placement. These wireframes often use placeholders like boxes and lines instead of real text or images.
Example: A hand-drawn sketch or a grayscale mock-up showing where the header, sidebar, and buttons will go.

- High-fidelity wireframes, on the other hand, are more detailed and closer to the final design. They include real content, images, accurate spacing, and interactive elements. High-fidelity wireframes are typically used later in the process to test usability, demonstrate functionality, and guide developers during implementation.
Example: A digital prototype made in tools like Figma or Adobe XD that shows how menus expand or how users move between screens.

# Wireframing Tools
Figma is a popular cloud-based design tool widely used for creating wireframes, prototypes, and user interface designs. It allows multiple people to work on the same project in real time, making collaboration easy and efficient.

Key features include:
- Drag-and-drop interface: Simple tools for quickly building layouts and adding shapes, text, and images.
- Components and templates: Reusable design elements that save time and maintain consistency.
- Interactive prototyping: Lets you link pages and create clickable mockups to test user flows.
- Real-time collaboration: Designers, developers, and stakeholders can comment and edit together from anywhere.

Figma is especially useful for wireframing because it combines ease of use, flexibility, and collaboration, allowing teams to move smoothly from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity prototypes—all within one platform.

# Benefits of Wireframing from a Software Development Perspective

Wireframing helps software teams visualize the structure and flow of a product before coding begins. It guides the design process by clarifying layout, navigation, and functionality, allowing developers and designers to align on expectations early. Tools like Figma make collaboration easier through real-time feedback and shared access. Overall, wireframing improves communication, reduces errors, and ensures a smoother transition from design to development.
